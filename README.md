**--QUICK SORTING:**

This sorting algorithm uses the idea of divide and conquer. Quicksort is a widely-used and efficient sorting algorithm that plays a fundamental role in computer science and data processing. Its clever divide-and-conquer strategy, along with its ability to sort large datasets efficiently, has made it a staple in software development and algorithm design. QuickSort's elegance lies in its ability to quickly rearrange elements in a list or array, making it a powerful tool for solving a wide range of sorting problems. In this introduction, we'll explore the core principles of QuickSort and its significance in the world of algorithms and data manipulation.

-QuickSort is a recursive algorithm. It employs a recursive divide-and-conquer approach to sort an array or list.
-QuickSort is not a stable sorting algorithm. 
- the big O notation of quick sort is 
- average-case scenario is O(n log n)
-worst-case scenario is O(n^2)

QuickSort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm.   QuickSort selects a pivot element and partitions the array into two subarrays: one containing elements smaller than the pivot and another containing elements greater than the pivot. It does this through a series of comparisons between elements and the pivot. The elements are then recursively sorted using the same comparison-based approach. So, in each step of QuickSort, it uses comparisons to divide and conquer the array until it's fully sorted. This makes QuickSort a comparison-based sorting algorithm.

**EXPLANATION OF THE CODE:**

QuickSort works like this:

- Choose a "pivot" element (here, we choose the middle element).
- Split the list into two parts: one with elements smaller than the pivot and one with elements larger.
- Recursively sort the smaller and larger parts.
- Combine the sorted parts along with the pivot to get the final sorted list.

NOTE: This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted.

**ANALYSIS:**

-AVERAGE-CASE TIME COMPLEXITY: The average-case time complexity of QuickSort is O(n log n), which makes it very efficient for sorting large datasets. This means that, on average, the time it takes to sort an array of n elements using QuickSort grows at most logarithmically with the size of the array.

-WORST-CASE TIME COMPLEXITY: it's important to note that the worst-case time complexity of QuickSort is O(n^2). This occurs when the pivot selection strategy consistently results in poorly balanced partitions, such as when the array is already sorted in ascending or descending order and a poor pivot choice is made. To mitigate this worst-case scenario, various optimizations, like choosing a good pivot (e.g., using the median-of-three pivot selection), have been developed.
